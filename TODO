= Short term ===================================================================

Noah: write unit tests

Mike: fix: video playlist override audio playlists when both directories
are listed in dmapd.conf

= Mid term =====================================================================

Mike: modular user interface

Noah: investigate XCode integration

Noah: iOS DAAP server App

Mike: dynamically adjust database when files are added to directories
(inotify?). See "Kernel Korner - Intro to inotify"

Noah: support playlists using totem-pl-parser

Mike: fix seeking (see libdmapsharing TODO)

Mike: is dmapd-dmap-db.c really needed? Why can't a loadable module just
implement an interface?

Mike: reconcile db with filesystem on dmapd start, store hash (include
dmapd version) to determine if up to date?  Fix handling of bad blob data
(DmapdD[AP]APRecord).

Mike: Migrate command line parsing to dmapd.xml.

See FIXME's in VIPS code

= Long term ====================================================================

Fix BDB code
	Existing DB, are proper ID's used for additional files read
	(e.g., maxint - last used id)?

	See by_location FIXME in db-builder-gdir.c.

Mike: Strings are copied a few times, but this does not seem to be as big a
problem as the GNode / DMAPStructureItem overhead.
	dmapd:dmapd-daap-record.c: g_value_set_string -> g_value_set_static_string
	libdmapsharing:dmap-structure.c: same as above.
should db_dir be in DmapdDMAPDb or
DmapdDMAPGHashTableDb? Should get dup or static_str?
