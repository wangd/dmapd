*** Grab exif thumbnail if available and read all exif metadata

	"Make" = camera make, "Canon" in "2007 Summer/StellaCar2c5x7.jpg"
	"UserComment" = comment
	"JPEGInterchangeFormat" = The offset to the start byte (SOI) of JPEG compressed thumbnail data
	"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength" = The number of bytes of JPEG compressed thumbnail data

*** Should db_dir be in DmapdDMAPDb or DmapdDMAPGHashTableDb? Should get dup or static_str?

*** Video playlist override audio playlists when both directories are listed in dmapd.conf

*** Allow user to set limit for memory image manipulation

*** Unit tests

*** Dynamically adjust database when files are added to directories (inotify?). See "Kernel Korner - Intro to inotify"
	
*** Support playlists using totem-pl-parser.

*** Fix seeking (see libdmapsharing TODO)

Is dmapd-dmap-db.c really needed? Why can't a loadable module just implement an interface?

Fix BDB code
	bdb: segfault if db already exists when dmapd starts

	big memory problem:
		ghashtable: 46,657,539 byte heap before DPAP client
		bdb: 911,716,352 byte heap before DPAP client

	see FIXME about memory lead in bdb

reconcile db with filesystem on dmapd start, store hash (include dmapd version) to determine if up to date?

Fix handling of bad blob data (DmapdD[AP]APRecord).

See FIXME's in vips code

Strings are copied a few times, but this does not seem to be as big a
problem as the GNode / DMAPStructureItem overhead.
	dmapd:dmapd-daap-record.c: g_value_set_string -> g_value_set_static_string
	libdmapsharing:dmap-structure.c: same as above.

Migrate command line parsing to dmapd.xml.

Update documentation in dmapd.xml.

GStreamer:
	- DV State change failed for /shared/Storage/Movies/2006 1707 Oak/2006_house_condition_5.dv Bugzilla #569924
	- Break up gstreamer packages (see OpenWRT example)

Why do some albums (e.g.: 2008 Landscape) appear blank?
